'Project Reference Defaults' for CodeRush
===
By default, when a new (non GAC) reference is added to a VS Project, it's **Copy Local** property is set to **true** and it's **Specific Version** property is set to **false**.

Sometimes this is not always desirable, and indeed studio lets you alter the values of these properties to suit your needs for any given reference.

However sometimes it would be nice to be able to alter those default to work differently.

'Project Reference Defaults' for CodeRush allows you to do just that.

Config 
======

Configuration is achieved through the CodeRush options screen **Ctrl+Shift+Alt+O**

The options in question, can be found under **Project\Default Reference Properties**
